NAME
     gzip, gunzip, zcat - compress or expand files

SYNOPSIS
     gzip [ -acdfhlLnNrtvV19 ] [-S suffix] [ name ... ]
     gunzip [ -acfhlLnNrtvV ] [-S suffix] [ name ... ]
     zcat [ -fhLV ] [ name ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     Gzip reduces the size of the named  files  using  Lempel-Ziv
     coding  (LZ77).  Whenever possible, each file is replaced by
     one with the extension .gz, while keeping the same ownership
     modes,  access  and modification times.  (The default exten-
     sion is -gz for VMS, z for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT, Windows  NT  FAT
     and  Atari.) If no files are specified, or if a file name is
     "-", the standard input is compressed to the  standard  out-
     put.   Gzip will only attempt to compress regular files.  In
     particular, it will ignore symbolic links.

     If the compressed file name is too long for its file system,
     gzip truncates it.  Gzip attempts to truncate only the parts
     of the file name longer than 3 characters.  (A part is  del-
     imited  by  dots.) If the name consists of small parts only,
     the longest parts are truncated. For example, if file  names
     are  limited  to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe is compressed
     to gzi.msd.exe.gz.  Names are not truncated on systems which
     do not have a limit on file name length.

     By default, gzip keeps the original file name and  timestamp
     in  the  compressed  file. These are used when decompressing
     the file with  the  -N  option.  This  is  useful  when  the
     compressed  file  name  was truncated or when the time stamp
     was not preserved after a file transfer.

     Compressed files can be  restored  to  their  original  form
     using  gzip -d or gunzip or zcat. If the original name saved
     in the compressed file is not suitable for its file  system,
     a  new  name is constructed from the original one to make it
     legal.

     gunzip takes a  list  of  files  on  its  command  line  and
     replaces each file whose name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, _z
     or .Z and which begins with the correct magic number with an
     uncompressed  file  without  the original extension.  gunzip
     also recognizes the special  extensions  .tgz  and  .taz  as
     shorthands   for  .tar.gz  and  .tar.Z  respectively.   When
     compressing, gzip  uses  the  .tgz  extension  if  necessary
     instead of truncating a file with a .tar extension.

     gunzip can currently decompress files created by gzip,  zip,
     compress,  compress  -H  or pack. The detection of the input
     format is automatic.  When  using  the  first  two  formats,
     gunzip  checks  a  32  bit  CRC. For pack, gunzip checks the
     uncompressed length. The standard compress  format  was  not
     designed  to  allow  consistency  checks.  However gunzip is
     sometimes able to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an  error
     when uncompressing a .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file
     is correct simply because the standard uncompress  does  not
     complain.  This generally means that the standard uncompress
     does not check its input, and happily generates garbage out-
     put.   The  SCO  compress -H format (lzh compression method)
     does not include a CRC  but  also  allows  some  consistency
     checks.

     Files created by zip can be uncompressed  by  gzip  only  if
     they  have  a  single member compressed with the 'deflation'
     method. This feature is only intended to help conversion  of
     tar.zip  files  to  the  tar.gz format. To extract zip files
     with several members, use unzip instead of gunzip.

     zcat is identical to gunzip -c. (On some systems,  zcat  may
     be  installed  as  gzcat  to  preserve  the original link to
     compress.) zcat uncompresses either a list of files  on  the
     command   line   or   its  standard  input  and  writes  the
     uncompressed data on standard output.  zcat will  uncompress
     files that have the correct magic number whether they have a
     .gz suffix or not.

     Gzip uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in  zip  and  PKZIP.
     The  amount  of  compression obtained depends on the size of
     the input and the distribution of common substrings.   Typi-
     cally,  text  such  as  source code or English is reduced by
     60-70%.  Compression is  generally  much  better  than  that
     achieved  by  LZW  (as used in compress), Huffman coding (as
     used in pack), or adaptive Huffman coding (compact).

     Compression is always performed, even if the compressed file
     is  slightly larger than the original. The worst case expan-
     sion is a few bytes for the gzip file header, plus  5  bytes
     every  32K  block, or an expansion ratio of 0.015% for large
     files. Note that the  actual  number  of  used  disk  blocks
     almost  never increases.  gzip preserves the mode, ownership
     and timestamps of files when compressing or decompressing.

OPTIONS
     -a --ascii
          Ascii text mode: convert end-of-lines using local  con-
          ventions.  This  option  is supported only on some non-
          Unix systems. For MSDOS, CR LF is converted to LF  when
          compressing,   and  LF  is  converted  to  CR  LF  when
          decompressing.

     -c --stdout --to-stdout
          Write output on standard output;  keep  original  files
          unchanged.   If there are several input files, the out-
          put consists of a sequence of independently  compressed
          members.  To obtain better compression, concatenate all
          input files before compressing them.

     -d --decompress --uncompress
          Decompress.

     -f --force
          Force compression or decompression even if the file has
          multiple   links  or  the  corresponding  file  already
          exists, or if the compressed data is read from or writ-
          ten to a terminal. If the input data is not in a format
          recognized by gzip, and if the option --stdout is  also
          given,  copy the input data without change to the stan-
          dard ouput: let zcat behave as cat. If -f is not given,
          and when not running in the background, gzip prompts to
          verify whether an existing file should be overwritten.

     -h --help
          Display a help screen and quit.

     -l --list
          For each compressed file, list the following fields:

              compressed size: size of the compressed file
              uncompressed size: size of the uncompressed file
              ratio: compression ratio (0.0% if unknown)
              uncompressed_name: name of the uncompressed file

          The uncompressed size is given as -1 for files  not  in
          gzip  format,  such  as compressed .Z files. To get the
          uncompressed size for such a file, you can use:

              zcat file.Z | wc -c

          In combination with the --verbose option, the following
          fields are also displayed:

              method: compression method
              crc: the 32-bit CRC of the uncompressed data
              date & time: time stamp for the uncompressed file

          The  compression  methods   currently   supported   are
          deflate, compress, lzh (SCO compress -H) and pack.  The
          crc is given as ffffffff for a file not in gzip format.

          With --name, the uncompressed name,  date and time  are
          those stored within the compress file if present.

          With --verbose, the size totals and  compression  ratio
          for  all files is also displayed, unless some sizes are
          unknown. With --quiet, the title and totals  lines  are
          not displayed.

     -L --license
          Display the gzip license and quit.

     -n --no-name
          When compressing, do not save the  original  file  name
          and time stamp by default. (The original name is always
          saved  if  the  name  had  to   be   truncated.)   When
          decompressing, do not restore the original file name if
          present  (remove  only  the  gzip   suffix   from   the
          compressed  file  name) and do not restore the original
          time stamp if present  (copy  it  from  the  compressed
          file). This option is the default when decompressing.

     -N --name
          When compressing, always save the  original  file  name
          and  time  stamp; this is the default. When decompress-
          ing, restore the original file name and time  stamp  if
          present.  This option is useful on systems which have a
          limit on file name length or when the  time  stamp  has
          been lost after a file transfer.

     -q --quiet
          Suppress all warnings.

     -r --recursive
          Travel the directory structure recursively. If  any  of
          the file names specified on the command line are direc-
          tories,  gzip  will  descend  into  the  directory  and
          compress  all  the  files it finds there (or decompress
          them in the case of gunzip ).

     -S .suf --suffix .suf
          Use suffix .suf instead  of  .gz.  Any  suffix  can  be
          given,  but  suffixes  other  than .z and .gz should be
          avoided to avoid confusion when files  are  transferred
          to  other systems.  A null suffix forces gunzip to  try
          decompression on all given files regardless of  suffix,
          as in:

              gunzip -S "" *       (*.* for MSDOS)

          Previous versions of gzip used the .z suffix. This  was
          changed to avoid a conflict with pack(1).

     -t --test
          Test. Check the compressed file integrity.

     -v --verbose
          Verbose. Display the name and percentage reduction  for
          each file compressed or decompressed.

     -V --version
          Version. Display the  version  number  and  compilation
          options then quit.

     -# --fast --best
          Regulate the speed of compression using  the  specified
          digit  #,  where  -1  or  --fast  indicates the fastest
          compression method (less compression) and -9 or  --best
          indicates the slowest compression method (best compres-
          sion).  The default compression level is -6  (that  is,
          biased towards high compression at expense of speed).

ADVANCED USAGE
     Multiple compressed files can be concatenated. In this case,
     gunzip will extract all members at once. For example:

           gzip -c file1  > foo.gz
           gzip -c file2 >> foo.gz

     Then
           gunzip -c foo

     is equivalent to

           cat file1 file2

     In case of damage to one member of a .gz file, other members
     can  still  be recovered (if the damaged member is removed).
     However, you can get better compression by  compressing  all
     members at once:

           cat file1 file2 | gzip > foo.gz

     compresses better than

           gzip -c file1 file2 > foo.gz

     If you want to recompress concatenated files to  get  better
     compression, do:

           gzip -cd old.gz | gzip > new.gz

     If a  compressed  file  consists  of  several  members,  the
     uncompressed  size  and  CRC  reported  by the --list option
     applies  to  the  last  member  only.  If   you   need   the
     uncompressed size for all members, you can use:

           gzip -cd file.gz | wc -c

     If you wish to create a single archive  file  with  multiple
     members  so  that  members  can  later be extracted indepen-
     dently, use an archiver such as tar or zip. GNU tar supports
     the -z option to invoke gzip transparently. gzip is designed
     as a complement to tar, not as a replacement.

ENVIRONMENT
     The environment variable GZIP can  hold  a  set  of  default
     options  for  gzip.  These options are interpreted first and
     can be overwritten by explicit command line parameters.  For
     example:
           for sh:    GZIP="-8v --name"; export GZIP
           for csh:   setenv GZIP "-8v --name"
           for MSDOS: set GZIP=-8v --name

     On  Vax/VMS,  the  name  of  the  environment  variable   is
     GZIP_OPT,  to avoid a conflict with the symbol set for invo-
     cation of the program.

     unzip(1), compress(1), pack(1), compact(1)

DIAGNOSTICS
     Exit status is normally 0; if an error occurs,  exit  status
     is 1. If a warning occurs, exit status is 2.

     Usage: gzip [-cdfhlLnNrtvV19] [-S suffix] [file ...]
             Invalid options were specified on the command line.
     file: not in gzip format
             The  file  specified  to   gunzip   has   not   been
             compressed.
     file: Corrupt input. Use zcat to recover some data.
             The compressed file has been damaged. The data up to
             the point of failure can be recovered using
                     zcat file > recover
     file: compressed with xx bits, can only handle yy bits
             File was compressed (using LZW) by  a  program  that
             could  deal  with more bits than the decompress code
             on this machine.  Recompress  the  file  with  gzip,
             which compresses better and uses less memory.
     file: already has .gz suffix -- no change
             The  file  is  assumed  to  be  already  compressed.
             Rename the file and try again.
     file already exists; do you wish to overwrite (y or n)?
             Respond "y" if  you  want  the  output  file  to  be
             replaced; "n" if not.
     gunzip: corrupt input
             A SIGSEGV violation was detected which usually means
             that the input file has been corrupted.
     xx.x%
             Percentage  of  the  input  saved  by   compression.
             (Relevant only for -v and -l.)
     -- not a regular file or directory: ignored
             When the input file is not a regular file or  direc-
             tory,  (e.g.  a  symbolic link, socket, FIFO, device
             file), it is left unaltered.
     -- has xx other links: unchanged
             The input file has links; it is left unchanged.  See
             ln(1) for more information. Use the -f flag to force
             compression of multiply-linked files.

CAVEATS
     When writing compressed data to  a  tape,  it  is  generally
     necessary  to pad the output with zeroes up to a block boun-
     dary. When the data is read and the whole block is passed to
     gunzip for decompression, gunzip detects that there is extra
     trailing garbage after the compressed data and emits a warn-
     ing  by  default.  You  have  to  use  the --quiet option to
     suppress the warning. This option can be  set  in  the  GZIP
     environment variable as in:
       for sh:  GZIP="-q"  tar -xfz --block-compress /dev/rst0
       for csh: (setenv GZIP -q; tar -xfz --block-compr /dev/rst0

     In the above example, gzip is invoked implicitly by  the  -z
     option  of  GNU  tar. Make sure that the same block size (-b
     option of tar) is used for reading  and  writing  compressed
     data  on tapes.  (This example assumes you are using the GNU
     version of tar.)

BUGS
     The --list option reports incorrect sizes if they  exceed  2
     gigabytes.  The --list option reports sizes as -1 and crc as
     ffffffff if the compressed file is on a non seekable media.

     In some rare cases, the --best option gives  worse  compres-
     sion than the default compression level (-6). On some highly
     redundant files, compress compresses better than gzip.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General

LHA is a
free file archiver/comressor popular in Japan. The default extention for
files produced by LHA is ".lzh". Most of the documentation of lha is in
Japanese. Brief instructions can be found in the file "lha.hlp".

This port is made from the cvs source code for "LHA for Unix" dated
20061009. The original source code can be obtained from the LHA home
site at "http://www sourceforge.jp/projects/lha". If you have trouble
getting it there, please contact me to have a copy emailed to you. The
changes to allow compiling under DJGPP have already been incorporated
into the main source, so no patch is needed.

This binary should work under plain DOS and also under Windows. It is a
command line utility, without any graphic interface. This port should
work with all of the different lha compression algorithms, including the
latest "lh7".

Authors License Statement (from man/lha.man, translated by
Osamu Aoki <debian@aokiconsulting.com>):

   Permission is given for redistribution, copy, and modification provided
   following conditions are met.

   1. Do not remove copyright clause.
   2. Distribution shall conform:
    a. The content of redistribution (i.e., source code, documentation,
       and reference guide for programmers) shall include original contents.
       If contents are modified, the document clearly indicating
       the fact of modification must be included.
    b. If LHa is redistributed with added values, you must put your best
       effort to include them (Translator comment: If read literally,
       original Japanese was unclear what "them" means here.  But
       undoubtedly this "them" means source code for the added value
       portion and this is a typical Japanese sloppy writing style to
       abbreviate as such)  Also the document clearly indicating that
       added value was added must be included.
    c. Binary only distribution is not allowed (including added value
       ones.)
   3. You need to put effort to distribute the latest version (This is not
      your duty).

      NB: Distribution on Internet is free.  Please notify me by e-mail or
      other means prior to the distribution if distribution is done through
      non-Internet media (Magazine, CDROM etc.)  If not, make sure to Email
      me later.

   4. Any damage caused by the existence and use of this program will not
      be compensated.

   5. Author will not be responsible to correct errors even if program is
      defective.

   6. This program, either as a part of this or as a whole of this, may be
      included into other programs.  In this case, that program is not LHa
      and can not call itself LHa.

   7. For commercial use, in addition to above conditions, following
      condition needs to be met.

      a.  The program whose content is mainly this program can not be used
          commercially.
      b.  If the recipient of commercial use deems inappropriate as a
          program user, you must not distribute.
      c.  If used as a method for the installation, you must not force
          others to use this program.  In this case, commercial user will
          perform its work while taking full responsibility of its outcome.
      d.  If added value is done under the commercial use by using this
          program, commercial user shall provide its support.


(Osamu Aoki also comments:
   Here "commercial" may be interpreted as "for-fee".  "Added value" seems
   to mean "feature enhancement".  )


Translated License Statement by Tsugio Okamoto (translated by
GOTO Masanori <gotom@debian.org>):

   It's free to distribute on the network, but if you distribute for
   the people who cannot access the network (by magazine or CD-ROM),
   please send E-Mail (Inter-Net address) to the author before the
