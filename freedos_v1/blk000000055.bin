er, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General

Description:  Mirror stores a copy of the boot sector, FAT tables, and root
              directory in a "storage location" near the end of the disk.

              By using the /partn switch with the mirror command you can
              save a backup of the partition tables to a partnsav.fil on 
              the a: drive.

Note:  The mirror image created by this program is only re-coverable by 
       using the UNFORMAT program for FreeDOS located at 
       http://www.23cc.com/programs/unxmat07.zip

Version History:

Version 0.1  Basic functionality:  Records the boot sector, 1 FAT table,
             and the root directory into a "storage location" near the end
             of the disk.  On this version, if any data is near the end of
             the disk it will be overwritten.  A future version of this
             program will solve this problem.

Version 0.2  Buffers are now dynamically created thereby reducing the size
             of the executable.  

             After testing it became apparent that the image is usually 
             stored between the end of a logical drive and the beginning
             of the next partition on a hard disk.  (This was true on version
             0.1.)  FAT table modifications will still need to be made on a
             floppy disk.

             Modified the code so that the space used by the mirror image 
             is marked as reserved in the FAT tables, if necessary.
             (Currently works only on FAT-16 file systems.)

             Added code to save a backup of the partition tables on the A:
             drive by using MIRROR /PARTN.  (MIRROR /P works too!)  The
             partition tables are stored in a file named "partnsav.fil"  The
             partnsav.fil is not compatible with MS-DOS's; but will be 
             recoverable with UNFORMAT version 0.8, to be released shortly.
             For information regarding the format of the partnsav.fil, please

******* WHAT mKEYB is ********************

mKEYB is a minimum keyboard driver for xxDOS, requiring
only ~500 bytes of memory to support international keyboards
	(russian 452, german 474, spanish 718 byte)

mKEYB is also an interesting demonstration of

	'The Art of writing small TSR's in High Level Language'

	mkeyb GRC - german with COMBI's
	mkeyb SP  - spanish (with COMBI's) (codepage 850)
	mkeyb NL  - dutch
	mkeyb UK  - united kingdom
	mkeyb BR  - Brazil (portugese)
	mkeyb BX  - Brazil (portuges) extended
	mkeyb RU  - russian - to be used with codepage 866
	mkeyb PL  - polish
	mkeyb HE  - hebrew
	mkeyb FR  - french (by snoopy81)

***languages  that are not verified, just more or less correct
***translated from the Xkeyb keyboard definition tables

	mkeyb NO  - norwegian
	mkeyb LA  - latin america
	mkeyb IT  - italy
	mkeyb DK  - daenish
	mkeyb PO  - portugese
	mkeyb SU  - finnish
	mkeyb SV  - swedish
	mkeyb SF  - swiss french
	mkeyb SG  - swiss german
	mkeyb SL  - slovenian



******* Implementation notes ******************

    mKEYB is based on the idea, that the keyboard is already
    (mostly) handled by the system BIOS, and that most keys
    are already correctly handled by it.

    this includes:
    function keys, cursor keys, ctrl,alt,del,shift,
    CtrlAltDelete, SysKey, ALT+numberPad, and most characters.

    also, all INT16 functions are already done by the BIOS.

    so mKEYB relies mostly on the BIOS to do what must be done,
    and only exchanges a few keys, as required by the national
    keyboard layout.

	mKEYBxx loads itself as high as possible; there is no need
	to LOADHIGH mKEYBXX



******* changing an existing language ******************

    to change an existing language, you need Borland's
    Turbo C++ 1.01; newer versions should work as well.

    please modify BUILD.BAT to your compiler directory.


    all keyboard definitions are located in a "keydefXX.h"
    file, where XX is the language you want to modify.

    change the definition file (see below), then run BUILD.BAT

    this should generate a new

        mkeybXX.exe

    testing the new keyboard handler is easy:

    start mkeybXX with any argument, and mkeyb will go into
    a debug mode, where all keys you type are shown; press
    ESCape to end this mode.


******* KEYDEFxx.H table layout:

    All keyboard definitions should be created, using some 
    predefined MACROS. these are
	

    PUNCT(scan,lcase,ucase) 
    	upper and lower case character definition
    ALPHA(scan,lcase,ucase) 
    	like PUNCT, but obeys CAPSLOCK rules
    	
    PUNCT_CTRL(scan,lcase,ucase,ctrl) 
    ALPHA_CTRL(scan,lcase,ucase,ctrl) 
    	like above, but additionally a CtrlCharacter is defined
    	
    ALTGR(scan,code) 
    	this scancode generates addition char if ALTGREY is pressed
    ALTGRSHIFT(scan,code1,code2) 
    	like ALTGR, but shifted key generates different key

    PUNCT_ALTGR(scan,lcase,ucase,altgr)           
    PUNCT_CTRL_ALTGR(scan,lcase,ucase,ctrl,alt) 

    REPLACE(scan,code)
    	replaces one scancode by another one (german keyboards
    	have 'Y' and 'Z' swapped)


COMBI tables:
    these are not needed by all languages, but some (like spanish catalan)
    require them. they mostly define '`^ + aeiou

    COMBI define characters, that are generated by two sequential
    keystrokes, like '+A, `+A, ~+A, for some swedish characters.

    if needed, COMBI must be defined in the keydefXX.h file.

    COMBI keys work like - for example for ^+A

main table:
    scancode for '^', NORMAL, COMBI11, 'x', 'y'

combi1table[] =
    {
    scancode for 'A', lower case a+^, upper case A+^
    scancode for 'E', lower case e+^, upper case E+^
    ...
    scancode for ' ', character '^' itself,character '^' itself
    }
    the last line is also used as default, for the case, that the next
    key is not 'AEIOUN', so ^+X will generate both '^' and X

******* adding a new language ******************

adding a new language (say japanese = JP)

decide, if you need COMBI characters or not

open MAKEFILE, search LANG_GR
duplicate this section, and replace all GR with JP

open KEYBD.C, search LANG_GR again, and duplicate again.


search an existing KEYDEFXX.H, that more or less closely
resembles your layout (say keydefGR.H),
and copy it to keydefJP.h

if there already exists (in xkeyb) a key definition, run

	C:\mkeyb> FC GR.key JP.key

add these changes to keydefJP.h



run BUILD.BAT, and you should have a mKEYBJP.EXE now,
ready to be tested (see above)

have fun with it

0.17 - 26 apr 02
    tom:  fixed CAPSLOCK handling
          added scan code display in debug mode
    bart: added UK table
    
0.18 - 27 apr 02
    tom: capslock handling for COMBI's corrected 
         added 10 other languages

0.25 - 29 mai 02
    tom: changed table definitions, so that polish 
    requirements (ALTGREY+SHIFT) are implementable
    saved a few bytes by that
    
    arkady: changed all keyboard definitions to
    use macros - less prone to errors

0.26 - released 17 jun 02
    some fine tuning by tom and arkady.   
    
    
0.32 - 9 august 02
    added brazil keyboard driver (BR+BX)
    merged all executables into a single one.
    slight increase of this single executable (4K->7K)
    but saves installing 20 .EXE files    
    
0.34 - 18 september 02
    added french keyboard

0.35 - 21 october 02
    corrections to french keyboard (provided by snoopy81)

0.36 - 10 feb     03
    added experimental belgique 

0.37 - 3 march 03
    belgian keyboard is OK for imre (after some corrections)
    added uninstall /U support
    added changing the layout on the fly by uninstalling old KEYB first
    renamed MKEYB.EXE to KEYB.EXE, as users probably expect KEYB

0.38 - 23 may 03    
    version 0.38 was done entirely by Anton Zinoviev; 
    I really appreciate it to be maintainer in that way :-))
    here is what he writes:
>>>    
    I added keydefbg.h and keydefbp.h -- these are the two Bulgarian
    keyboard layouts.
    
    For non-latin languages there must be some easy way to switch between
    QWERTY and the language layout.  Alt+Ctrl+F1/F2 are too uncomfortable.
    So I added the possibility to use the Right Ctrl as a switch for these
    languages (currently Bulgarian, Hebrew and Russian).  The right Ctrl
    acts as a switch only when it is pressed and immediately released.  It
    preserves its ability to generate Control codes.
    
    It was a real pleasure to read the code of mkeyb. :-)
    
    Anton Zinoviev
>>>    

0.39 - 24 sep 03
	finally implemented KEYB US - by deinstalling old keyboard handler
	added experimantal Slovenian keyboard
	
0.40 - 17 mar 04
	Changed the used EXE Packer; now APACK (http://www.ibsensoftware.com)
	is the exepacker of choice (although UPX still works exellent, too)
	This reduces KEYB.EXE by 200 Byte.
	This also changes the licensing, as GPL doesn't allow using exepackers 
	of my own choice :((
	See license.txt for details

2.  FUNCTION AND USAGE SYNTAX

	The MODE program performs six separate functions, which are
	described separately below.

2.1.  SET VIDEO MODE AND NUMBER OF SCREEN LINES

	MODE allows the video mode to be set to one of five modes.  The
	syntax is:

	MODE Videomode[,Lines]

	The modes are:

	MONO	Monochrome mode, as used with the MDA and Hercules adapter
		cards, and also emulated on EGA and VGA cards.	This mode
		is the only mode which has the ability to underline
		characters on the screen by default.  This mode cannot be
		selected on the CGA video card.

	BW40	40-column color-suppressed mode.  This mode is specific to
		the CGA adapter, and gives a display of 40 columns by 25
		lines.	The color information of the composite video signal
		from the CGA card is turned off, so that the display is in
		black and white on a composite color monitor, with sixteen
		shades of grey.
		If this mode is selected on an EGA or VGA card, or a CGA card
		that is not connected to a television set or a composite color
		monitor, it will appear the same as the CO40 mode (i.e. the
		color will not be suppressed).	This mode cannot be selected
		on MDA and Hercules video cards.

	BW80	80-column color-suppressed mode.  This mode is also specific
		to the CGA adapter and is the same as BW40 except that there
		are 80 columns.
		If this mode is selected on an EGA or VGA card, or a CGA card
		that is not connected to a television set or a composite color
		monitor, it will appear the same as the CO40 mode (i.e. the
		color will not be suppressed).	This mode cannot be selected
		on MDA and Hercules video cards.

	CO40	40-column color mode.  This mode gives 40 columns by 25 lines
		color display.	It is supported by CGA, EGA, and VGA adapters
		but not by MDA and Hercules cards.

	CO80	80-column color mode.  This mode gives an 80 column by 25 line
		display and is the normal display mode for CGA, EGA and VGA
		cards.	It is not supported by MDA and Hercules cards.	On EGA
		cards, this mode also supports a 43-line variant, and on VGA
		cards, the 43-line variant and a 50-line variant are supported.

		The 43-line and 50-line modes can be selected by specifying
		",43" or ",50" after the CO80 on the MODE command line.  If
		this parameter is not specified, the default of 25 lines will
		be used.

	Once set, the video mode will remain in effect until changed by
	a MODE command or by a program.  The video mode is not locked
	permanently - programs are free to change video modes as they
	require.

2.2.  CONFIGURE SERIAL PORT PARAMETERS

	MODE allows the communication parameters of a serial port to be
	configured.  The syntax is:

	MODE COMn:r,p,d,s

	n	Specifies which serial port is to be configured, in the range
		1 to 4.  If the serial port does not exist, MODE will report
		an error.

	r	Specifies the baud rate in bits per second.  Values are:
		50, 110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400,
		19200, 28800, 38400, 57600, and 115200.

		1200, 2400, 4800, and 9600 may be abbreviated to 12, 24,
		48 and 96 respectively.  14400, 19200, 28800, 38400, and
		57600 may be abbreviated to their first two or three digits.
		115200 may be abbreviated to 115 or 1152.

	p	Specifies the type of parity generated and checked on
		the data bytes.  Values are:

		E = Even parity
		O = Odd parity
		N = No parity

	d	Specifies the number of data bits that will be transmitted
		and received.  The allowable values are 5, 6, 7, and 8.

	s	Specifies the number of stop bits that will be transmitted
		and expected.  This may be 1 or 2.  If 2 stop bits are
		used in conjunction with 5 data bits, the serial port will
		actually generate and check 1 1/2 stop bits.

	Once set, the serial port parameters will remain in effect until
	changed by a MODE command or by a program.  The serial port settings
	are not locked permanently - programs are free to change them as
	they require.

2.3.  PARALLEL PORT REDIRECTION AND INFINITE RETRIES

	MODE allows parallel (LPT) port output to be redirected to a serial
	(COM) port, to NUL (i.e. nothing), and also can retry indefinitely
	if the peripheral fails to respond.

	These functions are performed by the resident portion of MODE, which
	will be automatically installed if necessary when the function is
	requested.

	The syntax is:

	MODE LPTn:P		Infinite timeout on parallel port
	MODE LPTn:=COMx		Redirect printer output to COM port
	MODE LPTn:=NUL:		Redirect printer output to NUL
	MODE LPTn:		Remove redirection and infinite timeout

	The LPTn:P function specifies infinite retries on timeout.  If
	this is enabled, MODE will retry continuously if the printer
	fails to respond.  If this is not enabled, and the printer fails
	to respond within a certain length of time (typically about half
	a minute), a write fault error will be reported.

	The LPTn:=COMx and LPTn:=NUL: functions specify redirection of
	printer output.  Any parallel port (whether it exists or not) may
	be redirected to any existing serial port, or to NUL.  More than
	one parallel port may be redirected to the same serial port or
	to NUL.  These functions are useful if you have a serial printer,
	or if you have no printer and want to avoid locking up the computer
	if a program attempts to print to a nonexistent printer.

	The LPTn: function removes any redirection and infinite timeout
	that may be configured for the specified port, and returns it to
	normal operation.

2.4.  HARD DISK PARK FUNCTIONS

	MODE will park the hard disk or hard disks (only the first two
	physical hard disks in the system), either immediately, or after
	the disk has been idle for a period of time.

	The timed park function is performed by the resident portion of MODE,
	which will be automatically installed if necessary when the function
	is requested.

	The syntax is:

	MODE PARK			Park now
	MODE PARK,minutes[:seconds]	Park after hard disk has been idle

	The PARK function parks the hard disk(s) immediately and waits for
	you to switch off the computer.  You can also press Ctrl-C to quit
	and return to DOS.

	The PARK,minutes[:seconds] function causes the hard disk(s) to be
	parked after a certain period of inactivity, which may be up to
	50 minutes.  If you have two physical hard disks, they are both
	handled separately.

	Once set, you can change the time period by executing the command
	again with a different time value.  The timed park function cannot
	be turned off - you must reboot to remove it.

	These functions are generally only useful for older machines.
	Modern hard drives park themselves automatically when switched
	off.

2.5.  TYPEMATIC FUNCTIONS

	MODE allows the typematic (auto-repeat) initial repeat delay and
	repeat rate parameters to be set, and optionally locked.

	The typematic lock function is performed by the resident portion of
	MODE, which will be automatically installed if necessary when the
	function is requested.

	The syntax is:

	MODE DELAY=d RATE=r		Set typematic parameters
	MODE DELAY=d RATE=r LOCK	Set and lock typematic parameters

	d	Specifies the initial delay, the range is 1 to 4 and the
		delay is between 1/4 second (1) and one second (4).

	r	Specifies the auto-repeat rate.  The range is 1 to 32 and
		the rate is between two repeats per second (1) and 30 repeats
		per second (32).

	LOCK	Specifies that the typematic parameters should be locked.
		Once this is done, the typematic parameters may be changed
		by runing MODE again, but cannot be changed by most other
		programs.  This can be useful, as some programs will change
		the typematic parameters without your permission.  It is
		not completely foolproof, however, and there are several
		things that a program could do which will defeat the locking
		feature of MODE.

	Note that both DELAY and REPEAT must be specified for these functions.

	MODE does not attempt to confirm that typematic setting is available
	on the machine.  I tried to do this using int 15h function 0C0h and
	int 16h function 9 but it seems that these are not fully supported
	by enough machines to be a reliable indicator.	MODE will accept all
	typematic commands, whether or not the machine actually supports them.

2.6.  SWITCHAR FUNCTIONS

	MODE can display and set the DOS switch character (switchar).
	The default switchar is the forward slash, '/'.  The switchar is the
	character that is used to indicate the start of an option switch, e.g.
	the /P switch to the DIR command.  Typically, the switchar may be
	changed to '-'.  The switchar is an undocumented DOS feature that is
	properly supported by few programs.

	The syntax is:

	MODE SWITCHAR			Display current switchar
	MODE SWITCHAR=x			Set switchar to character
	MODE SWITCHAR=n			Set switchar to ASCII value n

	The SWITCHAR parameter by itself causes MODE to display the current
	switchar.  The SWITCHAR= usage sets the switchar.  The new switchar
	may be specified as a character (e.g. 'MODE SWITCHAR=/') or as a
	number (e.g. 'MODE SWITCHAR=45').

2.7.  MODIFIER (SHIFT STATE) FUNCTIONS

	MODE can change the three sticky shift-states (caps lock, numlock,
	and scroll lock).  This function should not be used on machines with
	original PC or XT keyboards, because the indicator LEDs on these
	keyboards cannot be controlled from the computer, and will become
	out of step with the computer's shift-states.  MODE does not detect
	these machines, however.  On ATs and later machines, there is no
	problem.

	The parameter syntax for this command consists of the following
	options:

		CAPSLOCK=ON	CAPSLOCK=OFF
		NUMLOCK=ON	NUMLOCK=OFF
		SCRLOCK=ON	SCRLOCK=OFF

	Any non-conflicting and non-duplicated combinations of these options
	is allowed.  Also, SCRLOCK can be expanded to SCROLLLOCK.

3.  GENERAL

	Parameters to MODE are not case sensitive.

	MODE can only process one command on each invocation.  If you
	want to redirect several LPT ports, you must use a separate
	MODE command for each.	Commands of different types cannot be
	combined on the command line.

	Error messages are always sent to StdErr, which is not redirected
	by the DOS output redirection facilities.  Informational messages
	are sent to standard output, and may be redirected to NUL: for
	'quiet' operation.

	Errorlevels returned by MODE are as follows:

	0	No error
	115	Serial port does not exist (either for COMn: or LPTn:=COMx)
	117	No hard disk(s) found to park
	118	Specified video mode is not supported on this machine
	162	Insufficient memory (MODE requires about 6K of memory)
	241	Parameter out of range (e.g. time value, LPT port number etc)
	242	Cannot have 43-line or 50-line modes with modes other than CO80
	243	Unknown baud rate
	244	Must specify both DELAY= and RATE= for typematic setting
	246	More than one command or command type was given
	255	Incorrect usage syntax (all usage syntax errors)

	MODE is a TSR program.	If required, MODE will install part of itself
	resident in the computer's memory.  This resident portion performs
	printer redirection and timeout handling, automatic parking of the
	hard drive, and locking of the typematic parameters, and cannot be
	removed without rebooting (unless the public domain MARK and RELEASE
	programs are used).  If additional resident functions are required
	and the resident portion is installed, MODE will enable those
	functions in the resident portion rather than installing another
	resident portion.

	Because MODE is a TSR, it may be incompatible with applications
	or other TSRs you may be using.  If problems occur, try to establish
	which programs are conflicting.  It may be possible to avoid the
	problem by installing the programs in a different order.

	If you find a bug in MODE, please inform the author.  The contact
	details are given in section 1 of this document and in the source
	code.

4.  USAGE EXAMPLES

	Here is a sample of MODE's usage in AUTOEXEC.BAT, demonstrating all
	features:

	mode co80,43			>nul:
	mode com1:96,n,8,1		>nul:
	mode com2:19,n,8,1		>nul:
	mode com3:24,n,8,1		>nul:
	mode lpt1:=com2			>nul:
	mode lpt1:p			>nul:
	mode lpt2:=nul:			>nul:
	mode lpt3:=nul:			>nul:
	mode park,0:30			>nul:
	mode delay=1 rate=32 lock	>nul:
	mode switchar=-			>nul:
	mode numlock=off		>nul:

	This sequence firsts selects 43-line color display mode, then
	configures the serial port parameters for COM1, COM2 and COM3
	(9600, 19200, and 2400 bps respectively, with no parity, eight
	data bits and one stop bit).  These serial port parameters are
	not locked permanently, and another MODE command or another
	program may change these at any time.
	Then, LPT1 output is redirected to COM2, so anything that is
	printed to LPT1 will be sent out COM2 instead, at 19200 bps
	(for example, to a serial laser printer), and LPT2 and LPT3
	are redirected to NUL so that anything that is sent to them
	will go nowhere.
	Then a timed hard disk park is installed, which will park the
	hard disk(s) after 30 seconds of no hard disk activity.
	Finally, the shortest delay and fastest rate for the keyboard
	typematic function is selected and locked, and the DOS switchar
	is set to a hyphen ('-').
